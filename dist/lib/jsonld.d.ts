 *
 * There is one neat trick in the generated code: the JSON-LD code, usually,
 * becomes very complicated if the structure is not a tree. This problem is handled here
 * by the repeated usage of reverse properties that put, in the JSON sense,
 * the vocabulary itself on the top, linked to the individual terms via a
 * (reversed) rdfs:isDefinedBy. (See the definition of the 'rdfs_classes',
 * 'rdfs_properties', and 'rdfs_instances'). Thanks to Gregg Kellogg for that trick...
